# Hello, I'm Victoria! 👋

I'm an undergraduate Computer Science student at UFMG, currently in my fourth year (8th semester). I'm a Research Assistant at Speed Lab, where I work with data mining and machine learning.

## About Me

My current research focuses on model interpretability for classification tasks, using evolutionary algorithms as a core methodology. A large part of the projects I have been involved in are related to Computational Social Science, including the analysis of social network structures and the study of user discourse in online platforms.

I am also associated with projects on authorship style identification using Universal Dependencies and on evaluating the ability of Large Language Models to reproduce linguistic styles. In addition, I have participated in research projects in veterinary medicine, working on anomaly detection in thoracic X-rays of small animals across different research directions.

My main **research interests** include machine learning, model interpretability, evolutionary algorithms, and computational social science.

### Tech Stack & Tools

I mainly work with Python, C++, C, SQL, Git, and LaTeX.
